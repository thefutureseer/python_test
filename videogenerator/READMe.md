## 1. Go to Hugging face to get auth key

## Register a Google account and google drive to make each time after this one much quicker and easier and save your work.

## 2. Go to this pre made Google Colab [Google colab pre setup with ComfyUI](https://colab.research.google.com/github/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/blob/master/notebooks/comfyui_colab.ipynb)

## 3. In the colab secrets tab set up hugging face auth key variable and value

## 4. Make sure the runtime is set to T4 GPU by clicking the runtime tab (or the dropdown next to RAM/Disk) and in the dropdown click change runtime type. [ T4 GPU ] 

## 5. Run the top code file labeled Environment set up.

## 6. Run the second file for checkpoints

## 7 Make sure your in the proper directory and then run the 3rd file down to run the server (LABELED: Run ComfyUI with cloudflared (Recommended Way)). Be sure to watch the output underneath the file to find the GUI on the localhost.

## To turn it off go to the runtime tab and manage sessions

# Note: Google colab will reset after about 30-45 minutes and randomly so you need to start at the top file again or wait until GPU is available..
